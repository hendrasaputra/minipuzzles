# Puzzles

A shelf of small browser puzzle games, with tactile isometric worlds and touch-friendly controls.

**[Play at puzzles.hensap.id](https://puzzles.hensap.id/)**

**Petals**, our 3D Minesweeper, is the first playable game. It includes random board sizes, connected floors, learning puzzles, sounds, and local saves. Twenty more game ideas are on the shelf; their final GPT-generated icons come next.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 22.12+, 24, or 26+. In macOS/Linux Terminal or Windows PowerShell:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The homepage is the game library. Petals lives at `/games/petals/`.
